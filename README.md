# Stunlock

Stunlock is a proprietary (perhaps source-available upon release) web application developed in part of a university course.

Stunlock is a web application consisting of a client built with Vite.js, and a backend built with Express.js. The backend handles all heavier loads, user information, data, business logic etc. The application is hosted on a Linux VM with Apache2 acting as the web server.
